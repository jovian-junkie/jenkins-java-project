It is a CI/CD TOOL..

CI : CONTINOUS INTEGRATION = CONTINOUS BUILD + CONTINOUS TEST

MANUAL WORK WILL BE ELIMINATED
WE CAN FIND BUGS QUICKLY AND EASILY

CD: CONTINOUS DELIVERY & CONTINOUS DEPLOYMENT
CDEL : MANUAL PROCESS OF DEPLOYING APP TO PRODUCTION.
CDEP : AUTOMATION PROCESS OF DEPLOYING APP TO PRODUCTION.

ENVS:
DEV: DEVELOPERS
TEST: TESTERS
UAT: CLIENT
PROD: END USERS


TO DO CI, CDEL OR CDEP WE NEED TO CREATE PIPELINE:
PIPELINE: STEP BY EXECUTION OF A PROCESS.
SERIES OF EVENTS INERLINKED WITH EACH OTHER.

DEP -- > CODE + COMPILE + TEST + ARTIFACT
